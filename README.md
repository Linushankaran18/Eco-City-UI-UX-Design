# Eco-City-UI-UX-Design

Together with my talented teammates Linushankaran, Rishaanth Rajkumar, and Akilesh, I spearheaded the UI/UX design for Eco City, a visionary mobile application aimed at transforming urban living into a green and sustainable reality by 2050. Our app encourages city residents to adopt public transportation by rewarding them with exclusive offers and coupons, fostering eco-friendly habits and reducing the reliance on personal vehicles.

Key Contributions:

Wireframing: Developed comprehensive wireframes to establish the appâ€™s structure and user flow, ensuring an intuitive and seamless user experience.
Figma Prototyping: Created high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, enabling interactive simulations and facilitating effective collaboration and feedback loops within the team.
Journey Mapping: Designed detailed user journey maps to identify key interactions and optimize the overall user experience, ensuring that the app effectively motivates and retains users.
Project Highlights:

Sustainable Impact: Eco City aims to significantly reduce urban carbon footprints by promoting the use of public transportation, aligning with global sustainability goals.
User Engagement: By offering tangible rewards such as discounts and coupons, the app incentivizes users to choose public transport, making sustainable choices more appealing and accessible.
Future-Oriented Design: Our vision for 2050 focuses on creating smarter, greener cities where public transport is the preferred mode of travel, supported by innovative technology and user-centric design.
